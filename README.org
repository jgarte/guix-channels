#+TITLE: Read Me

This channel is for software which I use which will never be merged into Guix proper. Guix is a GNU project which means they will never allow packages which are non-free.

* Usage

To use this channel, place the following in =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/guix/channels.scm=

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(cons (channel
        (name 'katco-non-free)
        (url "https://github.com/kat-co/guix-channels.git")
        (branch "non-free"))
      %default-channels)
#+END_SRC
